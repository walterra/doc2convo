# ISSUE-0001: Add LICENSE File

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Type**: Legal Compliance  
**Effort**: 15 minutes  

## Problem

The project currently has no LICENSE file, which creates legal ambiguity. Without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning no one can use, modify, or distribute the code legally. This is a blocker for any public release.

## Requirements

1. Add a LICENSE file to the root directory
2. Choose an appropriate open-source license (recommended: MIT or Apache 2.0)
3. Add copyright headers to all Python source files
4. Update README.md to mention the license

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Create LICENSE file

For MIT License:
```

SOFTWARE.
```

### Step 2: Add copyright headers to Python files

Add to the top of each .py file:
```python
# Copyright (c) 2025 [Your Name]
# Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.
```

### Step 3: Update README.md

Add a License section:
```markdown
## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LICENSE file exists in root directory
- [ ] License is a recognized open-source license
- [ ] All Python files have copyright headers
- [ ] README.md references the license
- [ ] License is appropriate for the project's goals
